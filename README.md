## Getting Started

The course project is to implement the Top-Down and Bottom-Up parsers presented in Sections 4.4 and 4.6 of Aho et al., Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition). 

For each case, its algorithm receives a grammar (CFG) as input and can receive one (1) or more strings and must return as the only response whether or not the string(s) entered as input belong to the language generated by the grammar.

Through the course, we learnt about the theory behind the algorithms and data structures used to implement the parsers.

We choose to create the implementation in Python, because it is a language that we are familiar with and it is easy to implement the algorithms and data structures in this language.

## Install and Usage

**Note**: This program was developed using *Python 3.10.6*. It is recommended to use the same version to avoid any compatibility issues.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alejoriosm04/py-syntax-analyzer.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the program:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

**Note**: Please check that you have correctly saved the file `grammars.txt` in the same directory as the main.py file. This will allow you to use the grammars that are already defined in the file and calling the function with the main menu.

## Documentation

On this section, you will find the explanation for all the functions on this program. Please, take into account that those functions have
a very complex theory background, so it is recommended to have clearly understood the theory before reading this documentation.

### Grammar Definition

In the file `grammar.py` is defined the class `Grammar` which is used to represent a grammar. This class has the following attributes:
- `non_terminals`: A list of strings representing the non-terminals of the grammar.
- `terminals`: A list of strings representing the terminals of the grammar.
- `productions`: A dictionary where the keys are the non-terminals and the values are lists of strings representing the productions of the grammar.
- `start`: A string representing the start symbol of the grammar.

On this project, there are two ways to read and test and grammar. The first one is to read the grammar from a file. The second one is to read the user input. This works with the same funcionality in their respective functions.

The `non_terminals` and `terminals` attributes are read from the file or the user input and stored as lists. The `productions` attribute is read from the file or the user input and is stored in a dictionary where the keys are the non-terminals and the values are lists of strings representing the productions of the grammar. The `start` attribute is read from the file or the user input.

This data is sent to the Grammar class and created a new object. This object is sent to the respective functions to calculate all the necesary analysis data.

### Remove Left Recursion

Four functions were created to remove the left recursion from a grammar.

1. The `find_new_letter` function selects a letter that has not been used as a nonterminal in the grammar yet. It randomly selects a letter from a given list and checks if it has been used as a nonterminal. If not, it returns the letter.

2. The `eliminate_left_recursion_immediately` function eliminates immediate left recursion for a given nonterminal `A_i`. It separates the productions into two lists: `recursion` (productions that generate left recursion) and `not_recursion` (productions that do not generate left recursion). It then creates a new nonterminal letter using `find_new_letter`, updates the grammar by replacing the left-recursive productions, and increments the `count_Asub` counter.

3. The `remove_left_recursion` function is the main function that removes left recursion from the grammar. It initializes some variables and data structures, including `alphabet_new_nonterminals` (a list of potential new nonterminal letters), `dictionary_Asub` (a mapping of nonterminals to their corresponding `Asub` values), `dictionary_Asub_reversed` (the reverse mapping of dictionary_Asub), and `new_grammar_replace` (a dictionary to store the updated grammar).

4. The function updates the grammar by replacing the nonterminals with their corresponding `Asub` values. It then iterates through the nonterminals and performs the following steps for each nonterminal `A_i`:
    - It checks for possible left recursion with the nonterminals `A_j` (where `j` is less than `i`) and replaces the left-recursive productions accordingly.
    - It calls the `eliminate_left_recursion_immediately` function to eliminate immediate left recursion for the current nonterminal `A_i`.
    - It updates the `count_Asub` value for creating future Asub values.

5. The function constructs the final grammar by transforming the updated grammar back to the original nonterminal symbols using the `dictionary_Asub_reversed`. It replaces the `Asub` values in the productions with their corresponding nonterminals.

6. The resulting grammar with the elimination of left recursion is stored in the productions attribute of the Grammar object.

This function is specific of the Grammar, and its called before starting to calculate the syntax analysis.

It is important to mention that this function does not work if has cycles in the grammar. If it theres any production of the form `A->Aα|β`, where `β` begin with an `A`, then is not possible to eliminate left recursion by replacing the production with `A->βA'` and `A'->αA'|e`.

### FIRST

We defined a `FIRST`function in `grammar.py`, this function receives as parameters: the grammar, a symbol, a production and a dictionary of `FIRST` sets. This function returns the `FIRST` set of the symbol.

1. Initialize variables: 
- `position` is used to keep track of the current position in the list used to store the elements added to the FIRST set during the calculation.
- `list` is a list of lists used to store the elements added to the FIRST set for each production.
- `value` is a boolean variable used as a flag to avoid removing epsilon from the FIRST set if the current nonterminal symbol can derive ε.

2. Iterate over each production in the list of productions (`P`):

- Initialize a counter variable `counter` to keep track of the progress in the current production.

3. Iterate over each element in the current production:
- If the element is ε (epsilon), add it to the current list in the `list` variable.
- If the element is a terminal, add it to the FIRST set for the symbol and the current list, then break the loop to move to the next production.
- If the element is a nonterminal, recursively call the `FIRST` function to calculate the FIRST set for that nonterminal.
        
    - If the recursive call returns True, it means the nonterminal can derive ε, so add its FIRST set to the FIRST set of the current symbol and add the elements to the current list.
    - If the recursive call returns False, it means the nonterminal cannot derive ε, so add its FIRST set to the FIRST set of the current symbol, add the elements to the current list, and break the loop to move to the next production.
    - If ε (epsilon) is present in the FIRST set of the nonterminal and the value flag is False, remove ε from the FIRST set of the current symbol and remove it from the current list.
    - If the counter is equal to the length of the production, it means all elements in the production can derive ε.
    - If ε is present in the FIRST set of the last element, add it to the FIRST set of the current symbol, add it to the current list, and set the value flag to True.

4. Update the position variable to move to the next list in the list variable.

5. Check if ε (epsilon) is present in the list of productions (P):
If ε is present, add it to the FIRST set of the current symbol.

6. Check if ε (epsilon) is present in the FIRST set of the current symbol:
If ε is present, return True and the list variable.
Otherwise, return False and the list variable.

### FOLLOW

1. Iterate over each nonterminal in the set of productions (`G.productions`):
- Initialize a counter variable `counter` to keep track of whether all terms derive ε (epsilon) until the end of the production. If so, we need to calculate the FOLLOW set for the current nonterminal.

2. Iterate over each production in the list of productions for the current nonterminal:
Count the number of occurrences of the symbol in the production using the `count()` method.

3. If the symbol is present in the production:
- Initialize the index variable to -1, which allows updating the position in case there is more than one occurrence of the symbol in the production. This ensures that we ignore the previously evaluated occurrences and continue with the next one.
- Iterate over each occurrence of the symbol in the production:
    - Find the index of the occurrence and update the index variable to point to the next occurrence (if any).
    - If the index is not -1 (i.e., there is a valid index):
        - Iterate over each character next following the symbol in the production:
            - If `next` is a terminal, add it to the FOLLOW set of the current symbol and break the loop to stop evaluating the remaining characters.
            - If `next` is a nonterminal:
                - Add the FIRST set of the next nonterminal to the FOLLOW set of the current symbol.
                - If ε (epsilon) is present in the FIRST set of the next nonterminal, continue evaluating the remaining elements in the production, increment the counter by 1, and remove ε from the FOLLOW set of the current symbol that was added previously.
                - Otherwise, stop evaluating that production.
        - If the `counter` is equal to the length of the remaining characters in the production after the symbol, it means we are at the end of the production, and we need to use property 3. We add the FOLLOW set of the nonterminal from which the production is derived to the FOLLOW set of the current symbol.
            - If the FOLLOW set of the nonterminal is empty, we recursively call the `FOLLOW` function to calculate its FOLLOW set and add it to the current symbol's FOLLOW set.
            - Otherwise, we directly add the FOLLOW set of the nonterminal to the current symbol's FOLLOW set.

4. Check if there are no more occurrences of the symbol in the production:
Break the loop as there are no more occurrences to process.

5. Print the final `FOLLOW_SET` dictionary for debugging purposes.

Note: The code doesn't return any value, but it updates the FOLLOW_SET dictionary as a side effect.

### LL1() Parsing Table

First of all, we created a function called `give_positions`. This function is responsible for assigning positions (numeric values) to terminals and nonterminals. It creates a dictionary where the keys are the terminals or nonterminals, and the values are the assigned numbers.

Then, we created another function called `predictive_table`. This function is responsible for constructing the predictive parsing table using the given grammar, FIRST sets, and FOLLOW sets.


1. Create two dictionaries:
    - `positions_nonterminals` using the give_positions function to assign positions to the nonterminals.
    - `positions_terminals` using the give_positions function to assign positions to the terminals.
2. Create an empty list called `table` to store the values of the predictive parsing table.
3. Create a 2D table with `len(G.nonterminals)` rows and `len(G.terminals)+1` columns (including the column for nonterminals).
    - Initialize each cell of the table with the string "∞" to indicate that there is no data related to that position initially.
4. Iterate over each nonterminal `i` in the grammar:
    - Iterate over each production `j` of that nonterminal:
    - Iterate over each element `k` in the FIRST set of that production:
        - If k is not "Ɛ" (epsilon):
            - Check if the table cell at the position `[positions_nonterminals[i]][positions_terminals[k]]` is "∞":
                - If it is "∞", assign the corresponding production G.productions[i][j] to that table cell.
                - Otherwise, return False indicating a conflict in the parsing table.
        - If `k` is "Ɛ" (epsilon):
            - Iterate over each element `z` in the FOLLOW set of `i`:
                - Check if the table cell at the position `[positions_nonterminals[i]][positions_terminals[z]]` is "∞":
                - If it is "∞", assign "Ɛ" to that table cell.
                - Otherwise, return `False` indicating a conflict in the parsing table.
5. Call the `print_table` function to print the constructed parsing table.
6. Call the `string_input_top_down` function to analyze strings using the constructed parsing table.

Finally:
1. Create an instance of the PrettyTable class called `pretty_table`.
2. Set the field names of the table using the list of terminal positions as column headers, preceded by an empty string as the column for nonterminals.
3. Create a copy of the `table` list to avoid modifying the original list.
4. For each row in the `table`:
    - Convert the row to a deque to manipulate it easily.
    - Add the corresponding nonterminal to the beginning of the deque.
    - Convert the deque back to a list.
5. Add each row to the `pretty_table`.
6. Print the table title and the `pretty_table`.


### String Analysis - (Top-Down)

1. This function receives the string that the user enters and the G object that contains the grammar.
2. The deque library is used to create a stack that will be used to evaluate the string.
3. The stack is initialized with the non-terminal symbol and the initial symbol of the grammar. The latter is at the top of the stack.
4. The function checks that the string entered by the user is in the language of the grammar. If not, it returns an error.
5. The string is concatenated with the symbol $ to know that the string was fully traversed.
6. Then, X is assigned the value of the top of the stack and a is assigned the value of the first character in the string.
7. While the top of the stack is different from $, the function performs the following steps:
    - If X is a terminal, the function checks if it is equal to a. If so, it removes X from the stack and updates the string and a.
    - If X is a non-terminal, the function checks if the value in the table at the position of X and a is equal to "∞". If so, it returns an error.
    - If not, the function removes X from the stack and reverses the string in the table at the position of X and a. Then, the function adds each character of the string to the stack.
8. If the top of the stack is equal to $, the function returns that the string is accepted.

### Automata Bottom-Up - Closure and Goto

First of all, we created a function called `next_point`. This function moves the dot (•) in a production to the right.

Then, another function called `define_collections`. This function defines the collections for a given vertex in the bottom-up parsing algorithm. It extends the collections by considering the nonterminal symbols after the dot in the current items and collections.

1. Create an empty list called `visited` to keep track of visited nonterminals.
2. Iterate over each item in the `Vertex.items` list:
    - Check if the dot (•) is not at the last position of the item.
    - If the dot is not at the last position:
        - Get the position of the symbol after the dot.
        - Check if the symbol after the dot is a nonterminal and has not been visited yet.
        - If the symbol after the dot is a nonterminal and has not been visited:
            - Extend the `Vertex.collections` list with all the productions derived from the nonterminal symbol.
            -  Add the nonterminal symbol to the `visited` list.
            - For each collection in `Vertex.collections`:
                - If the collection is "Ɛ" (epsilon), replace it with a dot (•) and add the nonterminal symbol to `Vertex.who_collections`.
                - If the collection does not contain a dot (•) yet, add a dot (•) to the beginning of the collection and add the nonterminal symbol to `Vertex.who_collections.`
3. Iterate over each collection in `Vertex.collections`:
    - Check if the dot (•) is not at the last position of the collection.
    - If the dot is not at the last position:
        - Get the position of the symbol after the dot.
        - Check if the symbol after the dot is a nonterminal and has not been visited yet.
        - If the symbol after the dot is a nonterminal and has not been visited:
            - Extend the `Vertex.collections` list with all the productions derived from the nonterminal symbol.
            - Add the nonterminal symbol to the `visited` list.
            - For each collection in `Vertex.collections`:
                - If the collection is "Ɛ" (epsilon), replace it with a dot (•) and add the nonterminal symbol to `Vertex.who_collections`.
                - If the collection does not contain a dot (•) yet, add a dot (•) to the beginning of the collection and add the nonterminal symbol to `Vertex.who_collections`.
4. Call `Vertex.who_derivate_general` to determine the derivation relationship between the items and collections.

Finally, we created the main function to create the automata, called `automata_button_up`. This function builds the parsing automaton in the bottom-up parsing algorithm. It creates vertices and edges based on the items and collections.

1. Call `define_collections` to create the collections for the current vertex.
2. Combine the items and collections into a single list called `elements`.
3. Increment the `id_current_table` to get the identifier for the next table (vertex).
4. Iterate over each element in `elements` (items and collections):
    - Initialize `count_differents` as 0, which will count the number of different vertices encountered.
    - If the dot (•) is not at the last position of the element:
        - Create a list called `new_items` to store the items for the next table (vertex).
        - Append the element with the dot moved to the right to `new_items`.
        - Create a list called `who_new_items` to store the derivation relationships for the next table (vertex).
        - Append the relation of the current element to `who_new_items`.
        - Iterate over each element2 in `elements`:
            - Check if `element2` is different from `element` and if the dot (•) is not at the last position of `element2`.
            - If the symbol after the dot in `element2` is the same as the symbol after the dot in `element`:
                - Move the dot to the right in `element2` using the `next_point` function.
                - Append the modified `element2` to new_items.
                - Append the relation of `element2` to `who_new_items`.
        - Iterate over the vertices in `automata.vertices`:
            - Check if the sorted items of the vertex are not equal to the sorted `new_items`.
            - If they are not equal, increment `count_differents` by 1.
            - If they are equal, break the loop.
        - If `count_differents` is equal to the number of vertices in `automata.vertices`, the vertex does not exist yet:
            - Add a new vertex to `automata` with the `id_next_table` and `new_items`.
            - Add an edge between the current table (vertex) and the new table (vertex) with the symbol after the dot as the label.
            - Recursively call `automata_bottom_up` with the new table (vertex) and increment `id_next_table` by 1.
        - If the vertex already exists, add an edge between the current table (vertex) and the existing table (vertex) using `count_differents` as the identifier.
5. Return `id_next_table` as the identifier for the next table (vertex) in the automaton.

#### Automata Bottom-Up - Parsing Table

This function generates the bottom-up parsing table based on the constructed automaton, grammar, and follow sets.

1. Initialize an empty list called `table` to store the entries of the parsing table.
2. Determine the row and column numerations for the table using the `give_positions` function.
3. Create the initial table with "∞" entries for each cell.
4. Create a dictionary called `number_each_production` to map each production to a number.
5. Populate `number_each_production` by assigning a number to each production in the grammar.
6. Iterate over each vertex in the automaton:
    - Iterate over each neighboring vertex (tuple_neighbour) of the current vertex:
        - If the neighboring vertex is a nonterminal:
            - Check if the corresponding cell in the parsing table is empty ("∞").
            - If it is empty, assign the neighboring vertex number to the table cell.
            - Otherwise, return False (conflict in the table).
        - If the neighboring vertex is a terminal:
            - Check if the corresponding cell in the parsing table is empty ("∞").
            - If it is empty, assign "S" followed by the neighboring vertex number to the table cell.
            - Otherwise, return False (conflict in the table).
    - Combine the items and collections of the current vertex into a list called `union_items_collections`.
    - Iterate over each item_or_collection in `union_items_collections`:
        - If the dot (•) is at the last position of the item_or_collection:
            - If the relation of the item_or_collection is "δ":
                - Check if the corresponding cell in the parsing table for the end of input marker ($) is empty ("∞").
                - If it is empty, assign "A" to the table cell.
                - Otherwise, return False (conflict in the table).
            - Otherwise:
                - Find the number associated with the production in `number_each_production`.
                - Iterate over the terminals in the follow set of the production's nonterminal:
                    - Check if the corresponding cell in the parsing table is empty ("∞").
                    - If it is empty, assign "r" followed by the production number to the table cell.
                    - Otherwise, return False (conflict in the table).
7. Print the parsing table using `print_table`.
8. Print `number_each_production`.
9. Generate the string representation of the bottom-up parser input using `string_input_bottom_up`.

Please note that the functions `give_positions`, `print_table`, and `string_input_bottom_up` have not been provided, so their behavior is unknown.

### String Analysis - (Bottom-Up)

The `read_string_bottom_up` function reads a string and performs bottom-up parsing using the provided parsing table.

1. Check if each character in the input string is a valid terminal symbol in the grammar. If not, return an error.
2. Append the end-of-input marker ($) to the input string.
3. Initialize the current character as the first character of the input string.
4. Create a queue (deque) and append the initial state (0) to the queue.
5. Create a dictionary `dict_numbers` to map production numbers to production rules and their lengths.
6. Perform the parsing process:
    - Get the top element of the queue.
    - If the action in the parsing table is a shift (starts with "S"), perform a shift operation:
        - Append the state from the parsing table to the front of the queue.
        - Remove the first character from the input string.
        - Update the current character as the new first character of the input string.
    - If the action in the parsing table is a reduce (starts with "r"), perform a reduce operation:
        - Get the production rule and its length from `dict_numbers` based on the production number.
        - Remove the corresponding number of elements from the front of the queue.
        - Get the new top element of the queue.
        - Get the value to append to the queue from the parsing table using the new top element and the nonterminal symbol of the production rule.
        - Append the value to the front of the queue.
    - If the action in the parsing table is accept ("A"), return "String Accepted".
    - If none of the above cases match, return an error.
7. The function `string_input_bottom_up` repeatedly asks the user to enter a string for parsing until the user enters "0" to finish. It then calls `read_string_bottom_up` with the input string and prints the result.
